# OfflineBrowser
Offline Browser - An android app which can save the html pages and display when there is no internet.

As the app name suggests, the objective of this app is to download web pages such as wiki information when there is 
internet available and then the user should be able to load the saved webpages when the device is not connected to internet.

I did not had much experience when I was writing this application, so the code is not so clean, I am trying to improve the code,
and also the app functionality whenever I get free time.
